//! Wall joins: how wall ends are trimmed or extended where walls meet, and
//! how joined walls follow when one of them moves.
//!
//! Two walls whose ends meet (an L) are mitred, so their faces meet cleanly
//! at the corner; walls built of the same assembly then meet layer by layer
//! along the mitre. A wall that ends on the middle of another (a T) is
//! trimmed back to that wall's face; when both are layered, its core runs
//! on through the other's finishes to the other's core.
//!
//! Where three or more wall ends meet at one point (two walls of a run
//! ending on a partition's end, or four ends in a cross) the two that run
//! on most nearly straight, the thicker pair first, join each other as if
//! the rest were not there, and every other wall is trimmed back to their
//! faces as at a T, its core running on to theirs.
//!
//! Two walls that cross (an X) clean up too: the thicker one (or, as thick,
//! the one drawn first) runs through and the other stops at its faces on
//! either side, its core running on to the other's core when both are
//! layered. That leaves a [`Gap`] in the second wall.
//!
//! Ends don't have to coincide exactly: an end within a wall's thickness
//! of where the centrelines cross still joins, so a wall nudged a little
//! keeps clean corners. Moving a wall also takes the walls joined to it
//! along ([`follow`]), as in Revit: their ends stretch to stay joined.
//!
//! An end whose join is disallowed ([`Wall::disallow_join`]) joins nothing:
//! it stays square, butting into what it meets, and the walls it met no
//! longer follow it (nor it them).
